![Ants Vs Bees](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa23/proj/ants/assets/splash.png)

This project is part of [CS61A Berkeley Course](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa22/proj/ants/). You implement in this project the ants and bees characters using OO Principles.
I had alot of fun while doing this project. You can look at the full details of the project in the previous link.
**Important Note**: The music is not part of the project but I added them because these songs fit just right.
